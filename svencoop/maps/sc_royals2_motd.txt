MISSION: 

Find four buttons to gain access to The Pyramid.
Kill The Pharaoh before his power spreads all over the world.

HINTS:

- After pressing each pyramidbutton you should see a short video of a triangle getting to its place above the gate at the respawn. You can see the team's progress from those triangles. They are in the same order than the buttons that must be found, beginning from the left.

- Check houses, rooms and hallways for those buttons. They are purple triangles, just like the ones above the gate.
