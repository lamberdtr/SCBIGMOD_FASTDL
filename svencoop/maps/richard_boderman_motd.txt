Defeat the army of Richard Boderman and take back Sven Co-op!

Use the Huey helicopter that is circling the map and the minigun near it to nibble away at the side mountain defenses. Try to rescue the Sven Co-op developers and forum members from the prisons that are located inside of the center mountain tunnels. They can help you fight.

Once you and your comrades have killed 270 monsters, the end sequence will occur. Do not think that this map does not end.
