The map:

Continues from the first map. There is a hole in the ground at respawn.
-----------------------------------------

In this map your only task is to make your way through all the enemies and find the last three pyramidbuttons. 

After pressing each button in sc_royals1 and 2 you should see a short video of a triangle getting to its place
above the gate at the respawn. You can see the team's progress from those triangles. They are in the same
order than the buttons that must be found, beginning from the left. 

----------------------------------------

Hint: Barney has spread the equipment all over the spawn area, so checking out the houses for anything useful 
would be a good idea. But why has he done that? Try get him to follow you and then tell him to stop and try to hit him
with a crowbar. Maybe then you'll understand.

Hint: If Barney's health drops to 50%, he will disappear (runs away for some reason).
So if you want to have fun with him, keep him in good shape.

Hint: WAY TO GET PAST FLOATING STONES: The right answer is triangle: If the rock has a calculation on it, it won't fall if the answer is number 3. 
For example 4-1. The rock won't also fall if it has 3 things on it. For example 5, 5 and 5. Or three circles. 

Hint: WAY TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE OF "Believe..." CAVE: Just walk straight towards the
other side's doorway and a bridge will appear under you.
 
Hint: After getting past the blood-pool-temple & Blooders and ending up to a room with planks, you will need a grapple to get forward. 
Climb up the remaining planks and try to spot the small, green slime on the ceiling of the hallway up there. Use the grapple to
pull yourself up. A Grapple can be found from one of the houses in the 2nd village. You can get to the
house from the sewers.
