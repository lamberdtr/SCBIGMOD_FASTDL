The map:

>
"What now?!"
<

The gate isn't open yet. You'll hear the nearby house explode. Way to the sphinx has opened inside it.

----------------------------------------

Hint: Barney has spread the equipment all over the spawn area, so checking out the houses for anything useful 
would be a good idea. But why has he done that? Try get him to follow you and then tell him to stop and try to hit him
with a crowbar. Maybe then you'll understand.

Hint: If Barney's health drops to 50%, he will disappear (runs away for some reason).
So if you want to have fun with him, keep him in good shape.

Hint (What to do): Go to the watercave next to sphinx an pull the purple headed leveler.
