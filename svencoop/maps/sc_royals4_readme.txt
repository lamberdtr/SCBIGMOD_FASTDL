The map:

>
"Gate to The Pyramid is finally open! Head to The Pyramid and send The Undead Pharaoh back to Hell!"
<

Your mission is to make your way to The Pharaoh and kill him.

----------------------------------------

Note (Start video): Here we will notice that Crazy Barney has turned evil, or has been evil 
right from the start. You still remember he had insisted to come and help the group with the mission? 
He had planned everything and only needed the group to get him to The Pyramid!


Hint (How to find key): Climb up to the cliffs next to The Pyramid and see the human grunt's sitting body. The key is next to him.

Hint (Puzzle): Easiest way to get past the puzzle in The Pyramid is to push all the purple boxes neccessary on the purple-marked
plates (one per plate) and then press all the buttons that control the plates. This way you only have to press them once. 
After that you will have to push some of the boxes to their final places (deeper wooden areas under the plates). 
Before that you need to drop one box from the upper floor because one is missing. There is 1 extra box too just in case one of 
them gets stuck.

Hint: When at the end of the Pyramid, wondering where The Pharaoh is, try walking right in front of his coffin.
Maybe then something will happen.

Note (End video): After killing The Pharaoh you will see a video where The Pharaoh's weak figure and Crazy Barney walk along 
a hallway to whiteness. It's definitely not hell. The Pharaoh couldn't be sent to hell after all and he escapes with 
Crazy Barney to gain his strength back.
