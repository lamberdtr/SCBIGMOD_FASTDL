Prologue
--------
Some time ago we were captured and imprisoned in a 
hardened underground facility, we were experimented 
on and left to rot in a cell until one fateful day 
something went terribly wrong in the labs and everyone 
either got killed or transformed into one of ‘them’.
We had to escape before it was to late and after many 
hours we finally found the surface Access lift, but 
however it was blocked so we had to take the stairs 
which was no easy task and to add even more to it 
the Self Destruct system became active and destroyed 
any evidence of the labs and the inhuman experiments 
that happened down there. Luckily we were able to 
escape using one of their Osprey choppers but the 
controls were destroyed so the osprey crashed right into
another facility and we were captured again, What do 
they want from us!? We have been locked up in another 
cell and so here begins our story and our next ESCAPE!

* Replaced all AAATRIGGER textures to NULL to improve rendering speed
* Stopped players triggering the camera sequence from the code panel multiple times
* Fixed players being able to jump through the lasers to avoid damage if enough go through at once
