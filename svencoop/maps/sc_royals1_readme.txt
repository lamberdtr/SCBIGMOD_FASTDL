The map:

You arrive in Egypt. Captain of the local army makes radio contact with you. His men
don't want to get involved because of the rumour of a curse and you will have to help him...

>
"Hello group! We have had some problems and would want you to sort them out for us.
Barney insisted on coming and is here to help you out. He's brought some equipment.
Thank you again for volunteering. Good Luck!"

Mission: 
Kill The Pharaoh before his power spreads all over the world.
Find four buttons to gain access to The Pyramid.
<

There is also another army in the area. They have build up a base to a place where they
found one of the buttons. They are trying to solve the secret of these buttons and don't like you
sniffing around, so be careful. They are getting heavy attacks from Pharaoh's followers. It might help
you a little bit.

-----------------------------------------

In this (sc_royals1) and in the next 2 maps your only task is to make your way through all the enemies and find the four pyramidbuttons. 
In sc_royals4 you will go to The Pyramid and kill The Pharaoh.

After pressing each button in sc_royals1 and 2 you should see a short video of a triangle getting to its place
above the gate at the respawn. You can see the team's progress from those triangles. They are in the same
order than the buttons that must be found, beginning from the left. 

----------------------------------------

Hint: Barney has spread the equipment all over the spawn area, so checking out the houses for anything useful 
would be a good idea. But why has he done that? Try get him to follow you and then tell him to stop and try to hit him
with a crowbar. Maybe then you'll understand.

Hint: If Barney's health drops to 50%, he will disappear (runs away for some reason).
So if you want to have fun with him, keep him in good shape.
