You are part of a special branch of the military tasked with going into the classified research facility "Black Mesa" and extracting a scientist named "Gordon Freeman", alive. You are not part of the main military force sent into the facility to "cleanup". You may encounter some military forces who are friendly and will help you, and you may encounter some who are hostile. You are given permission to open return fire to protect yourself if you are fired upon.

UPDATED INFORMATION:

You have seen Gordon Freeman enter a portal and followed him through, in hopes of extracting him alive...
