ULTIMATE ATTACK
===============
By Pavel Davydov

You are Agent David Johnson, a Black Ops operative in the SC Institute's Cleanup Division.
After coming back from a successful mission at a secret military research complex in Area 69, the Boss has assigned you in the coverup of a large scale accident known as the Black Mesa Incident, said to have been caused by a physical anomaly refferred to as a resonance cascade.

As you make your way through the research facility, you find yourself in the wake of fierce conflict between HECU military forces and otherwordly creatures. It's upto to you to put an end to both and see to it that the nuclear payload is successfully delivered, that this catastrophe is lost to the pages of time... 

Hopefully if you make it out of this alive you'll get a large sum of money at the end of this and finally go on that long awaited vacation to Sven's Holiday Island Resort!
