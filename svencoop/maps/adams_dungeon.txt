.: Description :.

Yet another maze style map, but set in some random lost dungeon
at the top of some really big mountain in the middle of nowhere.
Decide wherever you like this mountain is, I don't care. Just
watch out for traps, and make your way to the end. You will know
when you reach it.

The skill levels have been altered, so you may find enemies you
come across are stronger and tougher than you'd expect.

Watch out for various secrets. Some can be very rewarding, others
are very deadly.

Be aware, this is an extremely difficult map. There is next to no
chance of escaping from a trap once you step inside it, and there
is often very little markings to show the map. You might want to
get out your stress ball now!

This map is best played with 3 to 6 players. At least 2 players
will be required.
